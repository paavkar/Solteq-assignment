# Solteq-assignment

An assignment I got from Solteq after applying for the Solteq Utilities Academy in 2022. I couldn't figure it out back then so I went back to it and made it now (August 2023). The application retrieves data from https://helsinki-openapi.nuuka.cloud/api/v1.0/EnergyData/Daily/ListByProperty?Record=LocationName&SearchString=1000%20Hakaniemen%20kauppahalli&ReportingGroup=Electricity&StartTime=2019-01-01&EndTime=2019-12-31 in the ASP.NET Core backend that is then mutated to monthly data and then sent to React TypeScript frontend that displays the data.
